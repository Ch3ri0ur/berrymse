# üçì BerryMSE

Simple low-latency live video streaming from a Raspberry Pi&trade; via the [Media Source Extensions API](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API).

Note: As of March 2020, Safari on iOS devices still does not support this API (excluding iOS 13 on iPad devices, which do support the API).

## Overview

H.264 Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units are read from `/dev/video0`, a
Video4Linux2 compatible camera interface. Each unit corresponds to one frame.
Frames are packaged into MPEG-4 ISO BMFF (ISO/IEC 14496-12) compliant
fragments and sent via a websocket to the browser client. The client appends
each received buffer to the media source for playback.

## Quickstart

Download executable from releases and run on a Raspberry Pi 32-bit (Buster) with a Raspberry Pi camera as `/dev/video0`.


This demo requires a Raspberry Pi with Camera Module (USB Video Class devices
not currently supported). As it uses the Video4Linux2 interface to access the
camera, the Broadcom v4l2 driver must be installed and the camera must be
enabled in `/boot/config.txt`.

!!! warning

    The new Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye (RPI OS V11) comes with libcamera as the new camera driver stack. This new driver has a changed API and isn't supported in berryMSE. The Old Driver can be reactivated by changing in the ``/boot/config.txt`` a view Parameters. Remove camera_auto_detect and add two lines.

    # Automatically load overlays for detected cameras
    #camera_auto_detect=1
    start_x=1
    gpu_mem=128

To fetch dependencies:

Linux:

    GOOS=linux go get -v ./...
    go install github.com/markbates/pkger/cmd/pkger


Windows:

    set GOOS=linux
    go get -v ./...
    go install github.com/markbates/pkger/cmd/pkger

Navigate to ./cmd/berryMSE

    cd cmd/berryMSE

To build:

    make

or:

    make armv6l
    make armv7l

To run, copy the appropriate `berrymse` executable to the Raspberry Pi and run:

	./berrymse -l <raspberry pi ip address>:2020 -d /dev/video<X>

For example:

    ./berrymse -l 192.168.2.1:2020 -d /dev/video0

The Raspberry Pi Zero uses the `armv6l/berrymse` executable. Other models use
the `armv7l/berrymse` executable.

The webpage will show a live video stream with approximately 200ms of latency.
The browser will buffer frames, providing a lookback window.

## Autostart service

In order to run the executable automatically please use the `register.sh` script from the for_autostart folder. There you can find a set of convenience scripts.
## Settings

Bitrate on default width height at least 1 400 000, if lower it will break
